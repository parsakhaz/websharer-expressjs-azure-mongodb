I added the functionality to check a website link for bootstrap, by checking if it is included in a script. If it is not included, nothing is displayed.

You can check it functioning with the following links:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/
http://kylethayer.com/

For styling, I made max-width 500px for the main results header in the html, and padding 100px for divs in the css stylesheet, which I believe looks better since there is more spacing in the box. I also added a line break under the input/preview url button to make it look less cluttered.

Additional piece of information that I added is the ability to add associated company name.

Nobody helped me with my code.
